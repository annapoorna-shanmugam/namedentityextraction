Performance Improvements:

Caching Mechanisms:

Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis or in-memory LRU cache) to store results of previously processed documents, reducing redundant computation and speeding up repeated queries.
Pre-trained Domain-Specific Language Models:

Integrate transformer-based models (e.g., BioBERT for healthcare, FinBERT for finance) using libraries like HuggingFace Transformers to improve extraction accuracy over regex/rule-based methods.
Distributed Processing:

Use distributed frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask, or Ray) to parallelize extraction tasks across large document collections, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Advanced Analysis:

Relation Extraction:

Develop or fine-tune models to identify and classify relationships between extracted entities (e.g., “works for”, “located in”, “acquired by”) using supervised learning or rule-based approaches.
Temporal Reasoning:

Implement temporal parsing and reasoning (e.g., using HeidelTime or SUTime) to order events, resolve time expressions, and build event timelines for domain-specific narratives.
Visualization Tools:

Build interactive visualizations (e.g., with D3.js or Plotly) to display entity relationships as graphs and event timelines as Gantt charts, tailored to healthcare or finance domain requirements.
