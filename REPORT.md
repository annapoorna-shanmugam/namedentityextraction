   - Solution: Implemented abbreviation expansion dictionary

2. **Dosage Pattern Recognition**:
   - Challenge: Complex medication dosing (e.g., "25mg twice daily", "400mg q6h")
   - Solution: Custom regex patterns for dosage extraction

3. **Temporal Expression Variety**:
   - Challenge: Multiple date/time formats in medical records
   - Solution: Comprehensive date pattern matching

4. **Context Sensitivity**:
   - Challenge: Terms with different meanings in different contexts
   - Solution: Context-aware confidence scoring

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

## 5. Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### 5.1 Technical Challenges

#### 5.1.1 Overlapping Entity Recognition
**Challenge**: Multiple patterns matching the same text span, creating conflicts

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
def _remove_overlapping_entities(self, entities):
    # Sort by start position and length (longer matches preferred)
    entities.sort(key=lambda x: (x['start'], -(x['end'] - x['start'])))
    
    filtered = []
    for entity in entities:
        overlapping = False
        for existing in filtered:
            if (entity['start'] < existing['end'] and entity['end'] > existing['start']):
                overlapping = True
                break
        if not overlapping:
            filtered.append(entity)
    return filtered
```

#### 5.1.2 Context-Sensitive Extraction
**Challenge**: Same terms having different meanings based on context

**Solution**: Context-aware confidence scoring using surrounding keywords:
```python
def _calculate_confidence(self, text, start, end, context_words):
    base_confidence = 0.6
    context_window = 50
    context = text[max(0, start-context_window):min(len(text), end+context_window)]
    
    context_boost = sum(0.1 for word in context_words if word.lower() in context)
    return min(1.0, base_confidence + context_boost)
```

#### 5.1.3 Medical Terminology Complexity
**Challenge**: Handling medical abbreviations and compound terms

**Solution**: Custom tokenization with medical knowledge:
```python
medical_abbreviations = {
    'mg': 'milligrams',
    'ml': 'milliliters',
    'bp': 'blood pressure',
    'ecg': 'electrocardiogram'
}

def custom_tokenize(self, text):
    # Expand abbreviations
    for abbr, full in self.medical_abbreviations.items():
        text = re.sub(r'\b' + abbr + r'\b', full, text)
    
    # Handle compound terms
    return self._process_compound_terms(text)
```
